# Changelog

## [Unreleased]
### Changed
- Update package to work with Elm 0.19. 
- Use `Color` package created for Elm 0.19, [avh4/elm-color](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/avh4/elm-color/latest/), which replaces the previous [elm/color](https://github.com/elm/color) package used pre-Elm 0.19.
- Backport code that works with Elm 0.18. This is meant to smooth the transition for clients in the early days of Elm 0.19. Support for Elm 0.18 should be dropped on the next version of this package, unless the next version must be released while Elm 0.19 is still new (September 2018).

## [3.0.1] - 2017-02-25

- Supports Elm 0.18.
